"""
Memory-optimized orchestrator for the data pipeline task.

This implementation focuses on minimizing memory footprint by:
1. Using generators and iterators for lazy evaluation
2. Processing data in small chunks
3. Minimizing object creation and duplication
4. Aggressive garbage collection
5. Using memory-efficient data structures
6. Explicit reference cleanup and avoiding closures
7. Using __slots__ for memory-efficient classes
8. Minimizing in-memory caching
