"""
Optimized orchestrator implementation for the data pipeline task.

This orchestrator demonstrates performance improvements through:
1. Caching the dictionary load
2. Using async/await for concurrent processing
3. Implementing retry with exponential backoff
4. Using efficient data structures
5. Deduplicating words to avoid redundant processing
